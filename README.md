# Sewer AI

This a repository of code we wrote for a use case provided by SewerMapper. The aim was to convert a 3D point cloud of a sewer into a 2D drawing. 

## Notebooks

You can open the notebooks using Jupyter notebooks. To install Jupyter notebooks 
```bash
pip install jupyter notebook
```
You can find lots of great ways to visualize 3D point clouds with the pyvista library in pyvista.ipynb.  For autosegmentation you can find code in the RANSAC for shape hunting.ipynb notebook.  For slicing point clouds you can find some code in slicing.ipynb.
